What is Datalizer?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Datalizer** is a Python library designed to simplify and streamline the data preprocessing workflow for data scientists, analysts, and machine learning engineers. It focuses on efficient data cleaning, validation, and preparation tasks that typically consume a significant portion of any data analysis project.

Core Features
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* **Data Loading**: Seamlessly load datasets from various formats (CSV, Excel, JSON)
* **Data Validation**: Automatically ensure datasets contain only numeric data
* **Issue Detection**: Identify missing values and duplicates in your datasets
* **Data Cleaning**: Apply different strategies to handle missing values and duplicates
* **Utility Functions**: Use decorators and helper functions to enforce data quality requirements

Why Datalizer?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Data preprocessing is often the most time-consuming step in the data analysis pipeline. Datalizer aims to reduce this burden by providing:

* **Simplified Workflow**: Standard functions for common preprocessing tasks
* **Quality Assurance**: Built-in validation to prevent errors in downstream analysis
* **Flexible Options**: Multiple strategies for handling data issues
* **Code Reusability**: Consistent interfaces that promote code reuse and maintainability

Datalizer is particularly useful for:

* Data scientists who need to quickly clean datasets before modeling
* Machine learning engineers working with numeric data
* Analysts who need to ensure data quality throughout their workflow
* Educational settings where consistent data handling practices are important
